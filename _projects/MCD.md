<p>MultipliCity Disorder was a collaboration with <a href="http://www.acmga.eu/">Angelique Chemois</a> (architect) and <a href="http://www.olawasilkowska.com/">Ola Wasilkowska</a> (architect) and a proposal to the <a href="http://www.europan-europe.eu/">Europan 9</a> contest. We tried to invest into network theory and ecosystem modelling in order to open up a new way to think the territory and the relationship between the architects, urban planning and the communities.</p>

<p>The main idea was to use a prey-predatory model to constraint diversity within a landscape. We also played with the concept of <i>strangification</i> to develop the idea that architectural intervention needed a translation effort.</p>
