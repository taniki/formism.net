<p>Convergences is a web visualization of convergences and divergences between the different languages of wikipedia as a proxy of distances between cultures.</p>

<p>The python code to reproduce the experiment can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/WeKeyPedia/convergences">github repository</a>. It relies heavily on the <a href="http://toolkit-python.readthedocs.io/">wekeypedia python library</a> and is a good example of how collective intelligence can be hidden in the network of links and metadata.</p>
