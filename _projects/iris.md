	<h4>The system</h4>

	<p>To clarify the visual representation, the system uses 3 differents dimensions.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The communities are ordered by proximities with the topic. Which proximities is represented as distance from the center.</li>
		<li>Being or not part of the community management is represented by contrast between active and passive actors. First one are colored and the latter none.</li>
		<li>Importance of the actors by them themselves are represented by the normalized size corresponding to them.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The code</h4>

	<p>The posters have been produced with a python script using the <a href="http://nodebox.org">nodebox framework/IDE</a>.</p>

	<p>The community mangers provided CSV files from their reports and we returned them the visualization in various vector formats (PDF, EPS and SVG) in order to be included in their own workflow (MS Powerpoint mainly).</p>

	<p>The software also used to let the possibility to parametrize the colors in order to producre posters more compatible with the client's branding.</p>
