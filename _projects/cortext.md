<h4>cortext manager</h4>

<p>The goal of the <a href="http://www.cortext.net/projects/cortext-manager.html">cortext manager</a> platform is to deliver a ready-to-go tool for humanities and social sciences researchers to perform text analysis over big corpora. Beside integrated text mining algorithms, the main up value was the integration of network visualization and mapping.</p>

<p>In this context, my task was to drive the design and development of the plaform through service design analysis and information architecture. </p>
