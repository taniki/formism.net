<p>This is a side project we are investigating with some friends in order to see if contemporary machine learning methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a> can be used to produce social mapping with layers of complexity.</p>

<p>Distributed computing over core grids is also a playground to look at viability of reading maps based on networks. After a simple statement formalization it is easy to <a href="https://github.com/taniki/comp.soc-of-philosophy/blob/master/map%20hypothesis%20validations.ipynb">see if hypothesis are strong over ten of thousands of different maps</a> produced with the same corpus and samples of that corpus.</p>
