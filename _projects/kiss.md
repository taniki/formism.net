<p>Small project for a small poster dedicated to the anniversary of <a href="http://weareblind.fr">blind</a>. We all designed and printed a poster for the occasion and made a cool party in a parisian bar. It was fun.</p>

<h4>The pattern</h4>

<p>The poster used a generative algorithm based upon a branching system derived from a small attraction/repulsion of "random" walkers. The letters or shapes can be grow by adding a set of repulsors.</p>

<p>It has been implemented with <a href="http://nodebox.org">nodebox framework/IDE</a>. The code is not formidable and could be a day or another on github. You can still ask by email.</p>
